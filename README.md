# MZS TOOLS

This plugin was created to realize a project based on a light and fast SpatiaLite geodatabase for data storage and maps production according to the italian "Criteria for Seismic Microzonation".

Seismic Microzonation studies are carried out in order to define zones, in urban areas, which have a homogeneous seismic behavior.

Seismic Microzonation studies include the following maps:

- Investigation map ("Carta delle Indagini"); 
- Geological-Technical Map for Seismic Microzonation ("Carta Geologico-Tecnica"); 
- Map of Seismically Homogeneous Microzones ("Carta delle Microzone Omogenee in Prospettiva sismica"); 
- Seismic Microzonation Map ("Carta di Microzonazione Sismica"). 

The plugin was created to give the opportunity to quickly perform standard compliant Seismic Microzonation studies.
