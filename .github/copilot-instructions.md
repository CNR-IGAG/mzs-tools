The project is a QGIS plugin for italian seismic microzonation data management.

The main development tools are uv for dependency management and just for task automation.
In the `justfile` there are tasks for running tests, managing dependencies and
translations, etc.
In `pyproject.toml` dependencies are grouped into categories such as `ci`, `testing`, and
`development`.

When launching terminal commands, use `uv run` to ensure the correct environment is activated. To avoid possible issues with the fish shell, the use of `bash -c` might be required to run commands that require a shell environment.

When adding text messages directed to the user, use the `QCoreApplication.translate` function to ensure proper translation support. Use a module level function or method for translations (keeping it at the bottom of the file), like this:

```python
self.tr("Dip Strike Tool activated.")
...

def tr(self, message: str) -> str:
    """Get the translation for a string using Qt translation API.

    :param message: string to be translated.
    :type message: str

    :returns: Translated version of message.
    :rtype: str
    """
    return QCoreApplication.translate(self.__class__.__name__, message)
```

Avoid translation of log messages, especially at debug level, as these are meant for developers and not end-users. Avoid translation of technical identifiers such as field names or variable names, as these should remain consistent across languages for clarity and maintainability.

The plugin uses pytest and [pytest-qgis](https://github.com/GispoCoding/pytest-qgis) for testing, with specific markers for unit tests and QGIS-related tests.

Tests are organized in 2 separate folders:

- `tests/unit`: testing code which is independent of QGIS API (uses mocking)
- `tests/qgis`: testing code which depends on QGIS API (integration tests)

Tests are organized using pytest markers:

- `@pytest.mark.unit`: Unit tests that don't require QGIS
- `@pytest.mark.qgis`: Tests that require QGIS environment
- `@pytest.mark.integration`: Integration tests

When running tests, use the `uv run pytest` command to ensure the correct environment is activated. If there are Qt library issues, use the `--no-group ci` option:

```bash
uv sync --no-group ci
uv sync --group testing
uv run pytest -v
```
